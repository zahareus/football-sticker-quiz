        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 22, 2025</p> <p>Welcome to StickerHunt! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the StickerHunt quiz game (the "Service"), accessible via https://stickerhunt.club. Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>StickerHunt is an online quiz game where users guess football clubs based on provided stickers within a time limit. The Service includes features such as user authentication via Google Sign-In, score tracking, difficulty levels, and leaderboards.</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To access certain features like saving scores and appearing on leaderboards, you must sign in using your Google Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
        <p>You may choose or be assigned a nickname for display purposes within the Service. You agree not to use nicknames that are offensive, vulgar, or infringe on the rights of others.</p>

        <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>To exploit, harm, or attempt to exploit or harm minors in any way.</li>
            <li>To engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service, or which, as determined by us, may harm the Service or users of the Service or expose them to liability.</li>
            <li>To use any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Service's servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</li>
            <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, or disrupt any parts of the Service, the server on which the Service is stored, or any server, computer, or database connected to the Service.</li>
            <li>To cheat or use exploits to gain an unfair advantage in the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service and its original content (excluding user-provided nicknames and scores), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of StickerHunt and its licensors. The football club logos/stickers displayed are the property of their respective owners and are used here under principles of fair use for commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research purposes (or specify your basis for use).</p>
        <p>Your nickname and scores, while stored by the Service, are considered user-generated content related to your use of the Service.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. StickerHunt makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
        <p>StickerHunt does not warrant that the service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; that any errors or defects will be corrected; or that the results of using the service will meet your requirements.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall StickerHunt, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide at least 15 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
